## About the Assessment

1. You need to share your screen soon, close all personal applications you don't want to share; you need only a code editor with terminal and a browser
2. Turn of all AI based tools on your code editor; Copilot, Tabnine, etc.
3. This assessment is not a school test; we do not hire or reject anyone based on how many tasks are done correctly
4. Explain your thought process while doing the tasks; I'm trying to get an image of your coding, problem solving and collaboration skills and see that you are cabable of working independently
