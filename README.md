## About the Assessment

### You need to share your screen soon

Close all personal applications you don't want to share; you need only a code editor with a terminal and a browser.

### Turn off all AI-based tools on your code editor

You can't use Copilot, Tabnine, etc. tools as an aide. There are links to related documentation on the descriptions of tasks for you to use and Google is allowed, but try not to use it excessively.

### This assessment is not a school test

We do not hire or reject anyone based on how many tasks are done correctly.

### Explain your thought process while doing the tasks

I'm trying to get an image of your coding, problem-solving and collaboration skills, and see that you are capable of working independently.
